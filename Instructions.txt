1.	COPY THE FOLDER "CLIENT" IN THE CLIENT COMPUTER
2.	COPY THE FOLDER "SERVER" IN THE SERVER COMPUTER
3.	FIND THE SERVER IP ADDRESS (USING ipconfig FOR EXAMPLE)
4.	PLACE SOME FILES IN THE CLIENT DIRECTORY AND IN THE SERVER DIRECTORY IN ORDER TO TEST THE FILE MOVEMENT (YOU CAN USE FILES FROM SAMPLE DIRECTORY)
5.	OPEN THE cmd CONSOLE ON THE CLIENT AND ON THE SERVER, MOVE TO THE CLIENT AND SERVER DIRECOTRY RESPECTIVELY
6.	RUN make ON EACH STATION
7.	RUN java ServerApp ON THE SERVER, THIS WILL START THE SERVER APPLICATION

9.	TYPE THE SERVER IP ADDRESS, AND THEN TEST ALL THE FEATURES OFFERED BY THE CLIENT APPLICATION:
	- GET [file name]: This command will recover a file from the server to the client directory.
	- PUT [file name]: This command will send a file from the client to the server and it will store it.
